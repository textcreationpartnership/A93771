            <title>Vindiciæ redemptionis. In the fanning and sifting of Samuel Oates his exposition upon Mat. 13. 44. With a faithfull search after our Lords meaning in his two parables of the treasure and the pearl. Endeavoured in several sermons upon Mat. 13. 44, 45. Where in the former part, universal redemption is discovered to be a particular errour. (Something here is inserted in answer to Paulus Testardus, touching that tenet.) And in the later part, Christ the peculiar treasure and pearl of Gods elect is laid as the sole foundation; and the Christians faith and joy in him, and self-deniall for him, is raised as a sweet and sure superstructure. / By John Stalham, Pastour of the Church at Terling in Essex.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are the people, among whom my lot hath fallen, for theſe fourteen years and upwards; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom I came, and with whom I have been, <hi>in weakneſſe, and in fear, and in much trembling.</hi> Yet in regard of Gods preſence and indulgence of Preaching-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties (with ſome ſucceſſe) all the Prelates times, and ſince, with his protection in theſe times of warre, I may ſay, <hi>The lines are fallen unto me in pleaſant places; yea</hi> (in God, <hi>the portion of my cup) I have a goodly heritage.</hi> And for you, I cannot but remember (to Gods honour) that inviting report which was given of you, that you were a faſting and a praying people; which I found true, among the beſt of you, who gave me a call hither. I doe not forget what example
<pb facs="tcp:114102:3"/> of Non-Conformity to Prelaticall injunctions you held out to me; nor what forbearance you allowed me for a time, in the uſe of the Ceremonies, which <note n="*" place="margin">M. <hi>T. Weld.</hi>
               </note> my Reverend and godly Predeceſſour had refuſed, and I through inconſiderate timidity and temerity had introduced, till God convinc'd me of my folly. I muſt needs acknowledge with thankfulneſſe to God and you, that ſome competent number of you have fallen in with me in a time of Publique Reformation, to witneſſe againſt Popery, Prelacy, Superſtition, Schiſme, Hereſie, Profaneneſſe and Formality, and have helpt towards their Extirpation according to Covenant.</p>
            <p>But in this, I queſtion how the reſt of you are, or will be approved to <hi>Christ,</hi> and your conſciences: Some, for leading, others, for following and perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a way of <hi>Needleſse ſeparation</hi> from me and your Brethren, and that privately, as publikely; and that after you had (upon conferences and debates) gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a <hi>true Church</hi> here in being, and have ſeen it come forth more viſibly, in the way to further purity; after our renouncing all dependency upon Prelacy, our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out of Ceremonies, and Service-book, as a menſtruous cloth, with a <hi>Get thee hence;</hi> our ſeeking after, with joynt-conſent, all Chriſts own Inſtitutions and our chuſing of his Officers: this is an <hi>un-Saint-like ſeparation,</hi> not to be juſtified, ſcarce to be parallel'd. Some for running to another <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> or diſclaiming my Miniſtery, and the above mentioned firſt Call, which other of your Brethren have ſtuck to, avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and renewed: by theſe, as other evidences (which might be produced, but that I ſpare you) it appears,
<pb facs="tcp:114102:3"/> the more <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath whiſtled and wooed you in, the more you have fled from the fold; the more I, his poor ſervant have been yours, the leſſe you have been mine, and with a clear conſcience I may write and publiſh it, the more I have endeavoured to love you abundantly, the leſſe I am loved of you.</p>
            <p>But that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath moſt againſt <hi>You</hi> (the ignorant and profane multitude I mean not, but <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours)</hi> is, that ſome have taken upon you the office of teaching, and re-baptizing; others, have hearkned after you, and you with them after falſe teachers, who have drawn diſciples after them, not only to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Baptiſme, but to <hi>another Goſpel</hi> (never fancied, but ever abhorred in this place, ſince I knew it, and before, in my Orthodox Predeceſſours time) <hi>which yet is not another;</hi> for the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is but <hi>one eternall Truth;</hi> but there be ſome that trouble you, and would pervert the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>univerſall</hi> (and when all comes to all but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary) <hi>Redemption by the death of Chriſt</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>for all.</hi> He that ſtarted this firſt among you, ſtirred my ſpirit, leaſt this <hi>leven</hi> ſhould ſpeedily ſpread thorow the whole lump, with all inſtancy and conſtancy, on Lectures and Lords daies, publiquely to witneſſe (in theſe following Sermons) againſt that which was too publiquely and boldly vented, though in a private houſe.</p>
            <p>And as at that time I acquainted you with ſome reaſons or cauſes, why I conceived <hi>God</hi> ſent in that ſubtle ſeducer, ſo now I will re-minde you of them. 1. For your countenancing the way of <hi>Anabaptiſme,</hi> and compliance with what they (who run that courſe)
<pb facs="tcp:114102:4"/> ſay and doe; as if all they ſaid were <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and all they did were <hi>godlineſse.</hi> 2. For your want of love to the truth, and of this truth, <hi>That Chriſt died but for ſome,</hi> which is a truth, or <hi>Chriſt died in vain</hi> for the moſt of men, for what ſhall it profit if any of Chriſts purchaſed ones ſhould win the world, and not win Chriſt, but loſe their ſouls? and all grant, moſt men will loſe their ſouls, and, that it is a blaſphemy to ſay, <hi>Chriſt died in vain.</hi> 3. For your Triall, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 2, 3. whether you doe ſoundly love <hi>God,</hi> and ſincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe <hi>Christ</hi> crucified. <hi>There muſt be</hi> ſuch <hi>hereſies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifeſt,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> in their ſolidity of judgement, ſincerity of heart, and ſtedfaſtneſſe of converſation, <hi>among you.</hi> 4. For your caution, leſt contending for circumſtances, above the ſubſtance, you loſe the ſubſtance, while you catch at the ſhadow. For Satan (by <hi>Gods</hi> permiſſion) hath ſet <hi>Pioneers,</hi> while you are ſeeking to ſet up the <hi>Roof,</hi> on work to undermine and raſe the <hi>Foundation.</hi> 5. To quicken up your diligence in the ſearch of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And laſtly, To make you more carefull in holding faſt of all Goſpel-truth, leſt you be plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it.</p>
            <p>Now, if any of you have been plundered, tis poſſible <hi>Brethren</hi> to recover this (with other truths) out of the hands of ſpoilers. Beſtir you therefore, and quit your ſelves as living ſtones of the ſpirituall Temple, of the living <hi>God,</hi> the Pillar and ground of truth. Doe not only regain, hold faſt, but as you hold out any colours of a viſible Church, hold forth the truths that appertain to the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, viſibly, gloriouſly.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:114102:4"/>
            <p> And I do now more ſolemnly call you out to witnes with me againſt this <hi>Errour</hi> of <hi>Vniverſall Redemption</hi> (let it be qualified how it will) it hath an ill ſavour and report. I wiſh you were all of you, as I hope moſt (for the preſent I know not any one who joyns in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, publique Communion, but are) free of this leven. Some in the Town are yet nibling at the bait, which the Fiſher brought, near a twelve-moneth ſince; whom I lookt upon, as one of our common vagrants, who ſcattereth vermine upon the bench or place, where he neſtleth for an hour or two; and ſtill I doe look upon this and other errours (with every Sermon that broacheth them) as very like to the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> which after the over-flow leaveth a world of mud behinde, that breeds nothing but venemous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Such muddy mindes had many after M. <hi>Oates</hi> his <hi>Sermon</hi> (as it was imagined of free grace) which have engendred to ſtrange conceits of their Redeemer, free-will, falling away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which makes me think, ſome are very neer to falling indeed, from that they have imagined to be in them, and from the true doctrin of free-grace, which we are ſure is yet retained in this, of many other publike Congregations.</p>
            <p>My counſell and requeſt further is, that you do not only witneſſe againſt errours and hereſies, but love the truth. Beware of ſubtle ſpirituall pride; keep cloſe to fellowſhip; help to reduce ſeduced ones; follow peace with holines. Beware of ſcattering opinions, ungroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded jealouſies; make no needleſſe, and ſo, ſinfull ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Come in to your <hi>Brethren,</hi> you that are wilfully or weakly at a diſtance; you that do not hear us, read us, and recover your hearing; you that hear, redeem

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>E pleaſed to take notice, that when I heard of this man my Countrey-man, come with a reſolution to ſow his ſeed at the corner of a <hi>Corn-field</hi> in our Towne: being jealous least it might prove as <hi>wilde,</hi> as that which he had ſcattered up and down in other parts of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> As God guided my thoughts, I deſired a faithfull brother to goe take his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon by Characters from his mouth, which he did moſt faithfully: And having read and compared theſe Notes, with anothers alſo, who wrote at that time; and receiving certain intelligence what impreſsions were left upon the mindes of his hearers: I had no reſt in my ſpirit, till (having laid all other ſtudies aſide) I had publikely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and anſwered the materials of his two hours Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. But never intended ſuch ſudden meditations for the Preſſe, till preſt hereunto by the deſires of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by the neceſsities of the weaker Chriſtian, and by the Adverſaries provocations for half a year together, who, finding a reſentment of the new Doctrine among ſilly women, and weak-headed men, gave out, that ere long, one that had never a hair on his face (and it may
<pb facs="tcp:114102:6"/> be, as little wit in his head, or grace in his heart) ſhould come and confirm what M. <hi>Oates</hi> had delivered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute my confutations. And according to their threats and brags, ſuch an one, or one like him, skipt into the ſame <hi>Corn-field,</hi> near a <hi>well,</hi> acted his part, did his beſt, and his worſt, and vaniſht: This youngster, ſtole in when we were not aware of him, ſo as for want of a Notary, we received but various reports of his worke, ſuch as I could neither make head nor foot of; only I am certified he wanted no railing rhetorique againſt our Ministers, who teach not Vniverſall Redemption, and a will in all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as <hi>Prieſts</hi> that have loſt their light. It ſeems he hath lived under ſome Prelaticall Miniſters, who affected that title; and inſtilled ſome drops of <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> into the <hi>Catechiſme</hi> they taught him, whereupon he imagineth all Orthodox and godly Miniſters, who had ever any thing to doe with Prelates, were of the ſame judgement with our Innovatours; but the Lord rebuke ſuch Railers, and ſtop the mouths of ſuch Liers.</p>
            <p>This was the laſt occaſion given me to fall upon tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing (out of my Characters, which to me is a tedious work) what I had preached againſt <hi>Oates;</hi> and having proceeded ſo farre, as to the Vindication of the Parable from his corrupt gloſſe, falſe collection, and ſutable application; in that very juncture of time, <hi>Teſtardus</hi> came to my hands (an Authour who hath been extant theſe thirteen years, that I never ſaw before) whom I read (as he deſires of his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his Epiſtle) <hi>a capite ad calcem,</hi> from the beginning to the end, yea over and over again, in ſtraights of ſpirit and time. And having all along ſought to the Father of lights for more clear diſcoveries of truth and falſhood; I had as little rest in reference to <hi>Teſtardus,</hi> as to <hi>Oates,</hi> till I drew up the diſcourſe, upon his tenet of univerſall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
<pb facs="tcp:114102:6"/> which is here inſerted and affixed to that I had preached and wrote before, about the ſame controverſie. The rather, becauſe I finde the <hi>Univerſaliſts</hi> of this time have lighted their candle (after <hi>Arminius</hi> was ſtinking in the ſnuff and ſocket) from this <hi>Teſtardus,</hi> and by comparing the Scriptures which <hi>Oats</hi> produced for his point, with this Authour; my Reader, and his, I think will conclude with me, that <hi>Samuel Oates</hi> was one of the diſciples (or <hi>diſcipulus diſcipulorum)</hi> of <hi>Paulus Teſtardus.</hi> I have a jealouſie alſo, I think godly, that ſome of our young <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks</hi> (who when challenged of <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi> doe apologize, they never read nor ſaw <hi>Arminius)</hi> are Pupils to this their <hi>Tutour,</hi> and are ſouldiers fighting under his <hi>banner,</hi> whoſe <hi>Colours</hi> are the <hi>Colours of grace,</hi> while he fights for <hi>nature,</hi> and of a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> while he fights for a <hi>Covenant of works and nature</hi> all along, as he ſpeaks of the <hi>non-elect,</hi> or reprobate, as <note n="*" place="margin">Fideles verò minimè <hi>decet Reproborum in gratiam</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam turbare. inquit ipſe. <hi>Teſt.</hi> The. 294, 295.</note> himſelf cals them. Now I leave it to others to ravel his bottom, and to exauthorize this <hi>Authour</hi> from the number of <hi>Claſſick</hi> and <hi>Orthodox. Truth</hi> is not afraid to enter <hi>errours</hi> den, becauſe, though it be dark, <hi>truth</hi> carrieth a light with it, to ſearch it out. I ſhall deſire my Countrey-Reader, to peruſe all that I commend to him in the controverſie with a Bible in his hand, and with humility and ſelf-deniall in his heart. My learned Reader, I intreat may have <hi>Teſtardus</hi> in his left-hand, and the two <hi>Teſtaments</hi> in his right. What is practicall will ſerve for all who have ſpirituall palats, and can reliſh ſpirituall nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>Let Jeſus Chriſt be thy <hi>Pearl</hi> and <hi>Treaſure,</hi> and thou wilt not make him <hi>common. Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in his Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention, Seſsion, Interceſsion at <hi>Gods</hi> right-hand, is not ordinary, nor for all; but for the man and <hi>Merchant</hi> that <hi>findes</hi> him, <hi>hideth</hi> him, <hi>joyeth</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:114102:7"/> in him, and <hi>ſelleth all,</hi> to make <hi>ſure</hi> of him. So we preach, ſo ye have believed, and ſo we ſhall, and muſt ſtill believe that we may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And for you M. <hi>Oates,</hi> my Countrey-man, as I have, acquainted my Reader in generall, ſo I muſt charge it upon you (as the principall ſtickler in theſe parts, with your new Goſpel and Baptiſme) that you provok't me, both to the preaching and printing of what here followeth, in reference chiefly to the Parables, and your Expoſition. Firſt, You preacht in the town, and to ſome of my ordinary hearers, and fellow-Members, without my leave; then you defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what you had preacht, to him that noted from your mouth. You returned me word from <hi>Colcheſter goal</hi> (whither and when, as thinking it a fit time and place for reflection, I ſent for your <hi>Recantation)</hi> that you would fain ſee me in print. And you ſeconded it at <hi>Chelmsford-Aſſizes</hi> to my face in the Market-place, that if I came forth, if you did not anſwer me, you would procure one that would.</p>
            <p>You may remember I then admoniſht you, as a Chriſtian, to forbear the ſpreading of your <hi>errour.</hi> You told me, you took it to be a <hi>truth;</hi> but if you have no ſurer props to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, then you gave me at that time and place, <hi>Actum eſt de tua cauſa.</hi> For then and there you informed me, you learnt this Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and to my anſwer, you were an apter Scholar then I, who never ſuckt ſuch milk from her brests, and to my queſtion, where? your Reply was, Doth not the <hi>Catechiſme</hi> in the <hi>Service-book</hi> teach it? Where, in Anſwer to the Queſtion, <hi>What doſt thou chiefly learn in theſe Articles of thy belief?</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Firſt, I believe in God the Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> I believe <hi>in God the Son, who hath redeemed me, and all man-kinde;</hi> But remember what I left with you at a preſent parting upon thoſe words (partly out of your
<pb facs="tcp:114102:7"/> deſire, lest the people ſhould flock about us, partly out of my reſpect, to what the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Go from the preſence of a fooliſh man, when thou perceiveſt not in him the lips of knowledge.)</hi> That <hi>Book</hi> nor <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> never went for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but as Prelaticall ſpirits might have framed thoſe words, or as you with them have wreſted the ſenſe, ſo you did act the Prelats part. For as I ſince finde, in the Title of that Catechiſme, it was <hi>to be learned of every childe before he be brought to be confirmed by the Biſhop;</hi> It ſeems you learnt it from your childehood, and it may be the Biſhops hands have been upon you at Confirmation, though not at Ordination. You are a true ſonne by this Confirmation, it may be; I am ſure by your Doctrine of the <hi>Prelaticall Church;</hi> and an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall text,</hi> is good enough, for <hi>Apocryphall doctr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of faithfull men in <hi>England,</hi> is a Church in or of <hi>England.</hi> Now what Church or company of faithfull men will you ſelect, as a pillar (of your ſuppoſed truth) that hath held out your doctrine of univerſal Redemption?

               <hi>only for originall guilt, but alſo for all actuall ſins of men.</hi> But tis one thing, for Chriſt to be a ſacrifice for <hi>all ſins of men,</hi> originall, actuall; another thing, for him to die for <hi>all mens ſins;</hi> or, to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>2. The company of <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> 7. Congregations of your own way of Anabaptiſme, who though they be diſtinct in reſpect of their particular bodies for conveniency ſake, yet are all one in Communion, They <note n="a" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>3. The company or companies of faithfull men, who differ only, or chiefly in point of Baptiſme, from you, and thoſe fore-named in London, but are with joynt-conſent, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited and knit together in fellowſhip of the <hi>Apoſtles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, breaking of bread and praiers.</hi> Produce me any of them, who for theſe 100. years and upwards, have in <hi>England,</hi> held forth your doctrine of univerſal Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or of the <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> No, they have ever been more <hi>pure</hi> in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> what-ever pollutions, too many we have had (the Lord humble us and make us aſhamed for them) in <hi>Diſcipline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope by this time, you will be aſhamed, with a ſhame and ſorrow that brings forth repentance, not to be repented of. And my hearts deſire to God for you, and the reſt of my ſeduced Countrey-men, in <hi>Norfolk, Norwich, Lin,</hi> is, that they may be reduced with you and ſaved with you: For I bear you record, that you have a zeal for Chriſt, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge. If you think to be ſaved, and to help
<pb facs="tcp:114102:8"/> to ſave others, by the doctrine of <hi>univerſall Redemption,</hi> and by the particular <hi>act</hi> of <hi>rebaptizing,</hi> and of being <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized,</hi> you will ſtill deceive, and be deceived.</p>
            <p>Perpend therefore and weigh with your ſelf, or rather, out of your ſelf, with the minde of God, in the Scriptures (as here, and in others more elaborate and ſpirituall diſſertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is) cleared and vindicated. Had you ſold your ſelf wit, fancy and conceit (in Gods matters for Chriſt and Goſpel-truth) you would never have ſo abuſed the <hi>Parable</hi> of <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all,</hi> and of buying the <hi>field</hi> and <hi>treaſure,</hi> as you did, when you opened your pack of wares in our Town. I know 'tis incident to us all to erre, but where ſelf-deniall prevails, <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> ſhall not prevail to <hi>hereſie. Errour</hi> is a ſerpent with a <hi>long tail,</hi> full of knots: if unwary, ſelf-confident perſons meet with it, it will winde in and enwrap, in it's endleſse train, a thouſand of them, <hi>with which they</hi> cannot but be <hi>ſtrangled,</hi> that do not <hi>ſtrangle</hi> it.</p>
            <p>I am afraid my old friend, <hi>T. More.</hi> ſometimes of <hi>Wels,</hi> was thus enſnarled by doubtfull diſputations, with the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Doctours of the times, who hath pleaded your cauſe (of generall atonement) in print. A book I could never meet with to this day; but the other day, when I had finiſht this <note place="margin">
                  <hi>By M.</hi> Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</note> Piece, there was preſented to my view, a godly, learned, friendly and faithfull Anſwer to that his book. I ſhall hope, by humility and ſelf-deniall, he will recover himſelf upon the reading of it, and I ſhall pray you may prevent him, or joyn, or follow in a <hi>Palinodia.</hi> Then will you ſee and ſay, it had been better for you both, to have kept to your <hi>looms,</hi> then to have <hi>ſpun</hi> ſuch a <hi>threed,</hi> which will not make a <hi>web,</hi> and that a <hi>garment</hi> to cover your nakednes withall. Repent, or you have much to anſwer, a heavy account to give up. For <hi>ſuch,</hi> as have had a better name for piety, then ever Prelates had, to make a more dangerous narrow
<pb facs="tcp:114102:9"/> bridge to Popery (then they did) by a more refined <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianiſme;</hi> For <hi>you,</hi> who have pretended to more ſanctity, then ever <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctours have done in familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Gods people, to be more efficacious in deceiving and miſ-leading unſtable ſouls; O, I tremble to think of the account. Repent therefore, and your errour of errours, yet will not be your ruine.</p>
            <p>But if the Lord leaves you to your free-will, and you be hardened from his fear, let him that you will procure to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me (if you cannot your ſelf) reconcile theſe contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, between your univerſality of Redemption, and your Anti-paedo-baptiſme.</p>

My ſcope rather is, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to what I have heard, and received from the undoubted word of truth, made known to me by the ſpirit of truth, which hath wrought effectually (as in other means, ſo) by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of this Authour, to confirm and eſtabliſh me in truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived before my acquaintance with him, and to deliver me out of the ſnare of ſome errours, in which I began to be entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled about that very time, in which I began to know him. And though I know him too well, to go about to winde into his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſteem, by painting and tickling encomions (who lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a purer, and more heavenly air then the vapour of mans breath, exhaled by a corrupt fancy, from a muddy heart) yet I deem it ſome encouragement to him that is ſet over me in the Lord (to watch for my ſoul) to be acknowledged in his work and ſucceſſe: and in ſo doing, I do only diſcharge a debt. Some of the ſtrong ſupporters of the rotten fabrick of <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> thou maiſt ſee him batter and raſe in this Diſcourſe: into which (ſince I was a waifaring man to heaven) I never tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:114102:10"/> in, to lodge for a night, finding it inconſiſtent with that foundation againſt which the gates of hell ſhall never prevail: <note place="margin">Eſpecially that of Saints apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy.</note> And for <hi>Paulus Teſtardus</hi> (his friend and neighbour) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but iſſue my thoughts, that he is here ſo fully enervated, and enfeebled, that when I read that paſſage in the book which concerned him, if I had been a woman, and in <hi>Elizabeths</hi> condition, when <hi>Mary</hi> came from the hill countrey to ſalnte her, the babe would have leapt within me for joy. Another errour occaſionally touched upon, I muſt crave thy patience to ſpeak a little to, and that is the opinion of <hi>Anti-poedoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme,</hi> in the lime-twigs whereof I my ſelf was once taken, and held, till by the Lords bleſſing upon the judicious, meek, and divine reaſonings of this Authour, I was enabled to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, the <hi>Arminian</hi> reſults that naturally, and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ariſe from <hi>Anti-poedobaptisticall</hi> grounds, while they both make the Covenant of grace dependent upon ſome ſpirituall qualification in the creature. And this I bluſh not to publiſh to the world, hoping that it may be for thy benefit. I am not ignorant that there are irreconcilable contradictions between the opinions of him, who is both <hi>Anti-pedobaptiſt</hi> and <hi>Arminian,</hi> a taſte whereof thou ſhalt meet with, in the cloſe of the Authours Epiſtle to the Reader: and no wonder, for errour is often ſo divided and engaged in battels and feuds, that thou maiſt meet with one corrupt opinion triumphing upon the neck of another, like <hi>Tamerlane</hi> upon <hi>Bajazet:</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and conſent being the honourable titles, and inſeparable attendants of nothing but truth. Nor yet doe I inſert this, as if I would inſinuate that every <hi>Antipoedobaptist,</hi> is an actuall <hi>Arminian,</hi> it being quite againſt my principles to repreſent any man in a worſe ſhape, then his own digeſted opinions put him into. And indeed, I have ſo charitable aſſurance of ſome of their ſincerities in ſaving truths, as if their eyes were clear enough to diſcern the fine-ſpun threds, by which thoſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſown together, I beleeve they would reject them both, for their contiguity ſake. Much leſſe doe I by any, or all of this invite a ſecular arm with it's iron mace, to cruſh and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the one or the other. For my part I ſhall call for neither

He is a man of many lovely and deſirable parts, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted to do much good, but thorow dangerous miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the ſatisfaction, which Chriſt hath made to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the behalf of ſinners, ſo deſperately corrupted, and (in a way as ſmooth as butter and oil) able to convey the ſame to others, as he is thereby apt to deceive and delude all the ſilly ſouls he meets with, and with ſuch (together with thoſe that are unſtable) our County, and (I fear) the Kingdom abounds, as the naturall effect of the brooding, and warmth of the feathers of implicite faith, and blinde obedience, ſcarce yet out of faſhion, though much pluckt off by the hand of light and truth, eminently encouraged, by our proſperous and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parliament. If my love to, and pity of wandering ſouls, did not exact from me theſe expreſſions (ſo contrary doe I finde them to the conſtitution of my minde, as) I ſhould be aſhamed to ſee them under my Name.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>The peculiar people of God, are Gods treaſure and jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</hi> A truth, but not here to be found.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God is found of thoſe that ſought him not.</hi> A truth, but not here primarily intended, only preſuppoſed; the Parables ſpeak of mans finding of God in Chriſt, and of Chriſt in the Goſpel, and only preſuppoſeth that God cometh in the Goſpel of the Kingdom, and findes him firſt by the preventing light of his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3, <hi>The providence of God is a ſtrong Tower.</hi> But this tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not built upon this Text.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Gods love is abundantly put forth towards his elect.</hi> We grant it, but not as the man intended it here, to obſcure, ſet by, and take no notice of the abundant love of Gods elect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt, which he ſpeaks to in this place.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſt parted with all his glory for the good of his elect.</hi> The Obſervation is good and pious, but not proper to the place; but in that Chriſt did part with all (as we finde it in other Scriptures) and that only for the elect: This indeed makes the Lord Jeſus a <hi>Pearl</hi> and <hi>Treaſure</hi> to every true believer, for obtaining of which treaſure, the believer parteth with all his baſeneſſe and glory too, in himſelf or in the world.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The Lord Chriſt did give himſelf for the world, that is, the whole world, or number of men in the world.</hi> This is the Obſervation, which the Obſervatour called a <hi>Doctrine hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born,</hi> and that which I called at firſt a falſe Doctrine (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his impertinent Obſervation) And which is the</p>

            <p>2. Parabolicall Texts prove nothing beyond their ſcope.</p>
            <p>2. Not in other Scriptures, although the late Interpreters <hi>light</hi> (as he ſaid) <hi>gave him, that Chriſt did die for the whole world,</hi> yet when we come to the Law and to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, if he (or any man) ſpeaks not according to the Word, in the ſound ſenſe thereof, it is, becauſe there is no <hi>light</hi> in him, but upon proof and triall, his <hi>light</hi> will be found darkneſſe, and how great that darkneſſe is, we ſhall judge bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Candle in our hands; or the Sun beams of <hi>Truth before our eyes.</hi>

            <p>A ſecond Scripture followeth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>He is the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle writes not, of no more then to, every ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, in the world, but of and to all believers among the Jews, as is demonſtrable from <hi>v.</hi> 7. where he ſaith, <hi>Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ye had from the beginning, and have heard from the beginning.</hi> Now, though the Gentiles had ſomething of the Commandment written in their hearts (before Chriſts coming) yet only the Jew had it written in books, and had heard of it by teachers ſent of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Leſt it ſhould be thought that Chriſt died only for the believing Jews. The Apoſtle enlargeth his aſſertion, as farre as Chriſt himſelf enlargeth it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 15, 16. to the Gentiles, ſpread all over the world farre and near; or as <hi>Calvin</hi> (whoſe Expoſition you may take aſſoon as a <hi>Catabaptiſts)</hi> the death of Chriſt belongs not to Jews only a part of the Church, but <hi>toti Eccleſiae,</hi> to the whole Church, or the Church in the whole world, in all ages, Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I ſhall prove it to be the true ſenſe of the words, and the Arminian ſenſe a falſe one, by theſe four Reaſons. <note place="margin">And vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by reaſons.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. From a parallel acception of the word <hi>world,</hi> Rom. 11. 12. where the phraſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the later clauſe, explains the phraſe <hi>world</hi> in the former: If the fall of them (the Jews) be the riches of the world, <hi>viz.</hi> of Gentiles; and yet when S. <hi>Paul</hi> cals the Gentiles the <hi>world,</hi> he doth not mean every ſingular Gentile, much leſſe every ſingular man and woman, what or whereſoever, no more doth S. <hi>John</hi> here in the place we are opening and vindicating, but he meaneth that Chriſt is a propitiation for the ſins of all that did, or ſhould believe,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114102:17"/> or were of Gods number among the world of Gentiles, as alſo the phraſe is uſed in the ſame ſenſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. preached unto <note place="margin">verſ. 1.</note> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> believed on in the <hi>world.</hi>

            <p n="2">2.

            <p>A third witneſſe muſt be heard ſpeak, and that is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15 vindicated.</note> 14. 15. <hi>Becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead, and that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi> This Scripture was ſet upon the rack, the other day, and made to ſpeak for that which it doth not intend; by putting a new ſcope upon the words, as if they came in to anſwer ſuch a queſtion as this; Whether all were dead or no? A new fancy! where findes he it, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were in ſuch miſtakes? But in his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114102:18"/> own fancy-full opinion, that all were not dead in ſinnes by <hi>Adam,</hi> even the elect, as well as others: The Arminian ſaith, all did not die in <hi>Adam,</hi> nor are they dead in ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>All were dead,</hi> and his ſcope is (from verſ. 9.) to excite others with himſelf to be ambitious of pleaſing God, though it be with the diſpleaſing of our ſelves, one reaſon hereof is drawn from the generall judgement, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. A ſecond from the ſpeciall <hi>conſtraining love</hi> of Chriſt, who died for thoſe that <hi>were as dead as others;</hi> even all of them that Chriſt died for <hi>were dead</hi> (that is not queſtion'd, but taken for granted) what then? ſhall Chriſts death for any that he died for be fruitleſſe?

            <p>Thus you ſee theſe four poſitive Scriptures, called in as witneſſes, ſpeak nothing for, but rather much againſt <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Redemption.</hi> It is a ſtrange boldneſſe to call forth Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to witneſſe againſt it ſelf; may any man take that boldneſſe?

            <p>2. Who denieth, what the Scripture elſewhere affirmeth, That Chriſt was a Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world, being promiſed and prophecied of from the beginning that he ſhould be ſlain, and vertually his bloud was ſhed, and his grace was effectuall to the ranſoming of all ſorts of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from the firſt, but here, <hi>Latet anguis in herba,</hi> under this green graſſe lieth hid a biting Serpent; for when Chriſt is revealed upon <hi>Adams</hi> fall, <hi>whole Adam,</hi> as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt it, or all mankinde is interpreted to be ranſom'd with <hi>Adams</hi> perſon, that day wherein he fell; which I will diſprove by theſe evidences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As ſoon as Chriſt is revealed, and with the firſt Goſpel that ever was preached, a difference is made and declared by God himſelf, between one part of mankinde and another, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam</hi> as ſoon as fallen, is no longer a publike perſon, nor doth Chriſt (by that promiſe) undertake for <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his poſterity; 'tis well if <hi>Adam</hi> (now in a private capacity) can eſcape for one; the Covenant of Redemption is not founded in him, but in the ſeed of the woman, the Lord Jeſus; nor is <hi>Adams</hi> enmity with Satan, and reconciliation with God there mentioned, but only the womans, and her ſeed, partly expreſt, partly implied.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:114102:23"/> 3. All died, as they ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> before this promiſe, but the promiſe is not made of, or to all mankinde who died vertually in him, only of and to the woman is it ſpoken, and her ſeed, the principall whereof ſhould be the redeemer, and the reſt of her ſeed, the redeemed ones of the Lord, between whom and the old Serpent, Satan and his ſeed, there ſhould be irreconcilable enmity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If you would know who, and who only, and what number they are, for whom (if you ſpeak of the certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals) the Lamb was a ranſome from the beginning, you muſt wait till the Lambs book of life be opened, of which we read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 8. and 17. 8. where plainly you may learn; That</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was not ſlain for any, firſt or laſt, but for ſuch whoſe names are in his book.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Comparing thoſe Texts with <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 3. there are a world of people, whoſe names are not written in his book, therefore <hi>not ſlain</hi> (in the Arminian ſenſe) for <hi>all</hi> the world; nor muſt this laſt place in <hi>Timothy,</hi> nor any of the former be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
            <p>We have now done with the Scriptures alleadged and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him, and vindicated by us, which I deſire you to hold faſt in the true ſenſe, not in a perverted interpretation; theſe were his <hi>out-works,</hi> which we have taken, and poſſeſſe we them for the Truth: Come we at length to batter down the enemies Forts and ſtrong-holds of his carnall-reaſonings, and confident arguments.</p>
            <p>Two Reaſons, and two Arguments were brought to prove his Doctrine, That Chriſt gave himſelf for the whole world: Now ſuch as have ſtudied Logick, or artificiall reaſoning, know no difference between Reaſons and Arguments; for it they be Reaſons, and do not argue, they are irrationall Reaſons; and if they be Arguments without reaſon, they are unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arguments.

            <p>I ſhall inſtance but in three places, the firſt in</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>Greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friends;</hi> and preſently to ſhew whom he laid down his life for, he addeth, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Ye are my friends,</hi> &amp;c. It is moſt true what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Sonne;</hi> But</p>
            <p n="1">1. What <hi>[We]</hi> meaneth he there? Not all men, but ſuch as are <hi>justified by faith, and have peace with God,</hi> by faith, <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the elect of God are enemies, as conſidered in themſelves, and in their naturall eſtate, yet being loved of God from eternity, with the love of good pleaſure, they have a price laid down for them by Chriſts death, to bring them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114102:24"/> under the love of friendſhip; and when they do actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they are actually reconciled, and of enemies are made friends: ſo that Chriſt laid down his life for ſuch, as were in Gods choice and love, his friends; and by Chriſts death, and the fruits of it, brought into a ſtate of actuall friendſhip. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> 10. 15. <hi>And I lay down my life for the ſheep,</hi> whom in the verſe precedent, he had called, <hi>his ſheep.</hi> See here, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, ye that love the truth, and love not to be ſeduced (though that is a weak property of ſheep, to wander) yet if you be Chriſts ſheep, hear the voice of the good ſhepherd, and not of ſtrangers; for whom doth Chriſt himſelf ſay that he died? he beſt knows, and is only able to reſolve this doubt; why, if you will believe him, who is truth it ſelf, <hi>I lay down my life for my ſheep,</hi> he doth not ſay for goats at all, but for <hi>the ſheep;</hi> behold and hearken after the harmony 'tween this and the fore-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged Scriptures; certainly, where Chriſt or his Apoſtles ſpeak in larger tearms of <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>world,</hi> and <hi>whole world,</hi> muſt not theſe tearms be limited to <hi>Christs ſheep?</hi> It was a ſubtill counſel your new Lecturer gave you, that other Scriptures, which he cited in the ſecond place, as but favouring his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould be expounded by the poſitive Scriptures; but be you as wiſe, as he was ſubtle, and learn to reduce all his poſitive Scriptures (which yet had Synecdoches in them, of the whole for a part, or of the generall for the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall) to and by this main <hi>Poſition</hi> of our Lord, <hi>a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall truth.</hi> Let this be firſt laid down, <hi>I lay down my life for my ſheep;</hi> and whoſoever ſhall (after ſo plain a <hi>foundation laid</hi> by Chriſt himſelf in his Word, and by his Spirit in your hearts) teach <hi>univerſall Redemption,</hi> or Chriſts dying for the bulk of mankinde, tell him he doth nothing elſe, but build <hi>hay and ſtubble</hi> upon the foundation; nay, he doth yet more wickedly, even lay another foundation with Chriſt, or beſides his purpoſe. A third and laſt, is in theſe words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 19. <hi>For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf.</hi> Chriſts ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying himſelf, is his preparation for death, ſetting himſelf
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114102:24"/> apart to die; for whom? for their ſakes, his eleven Apoſtles, not <hi>Iudas,</hi> v. 12. and for thoſe which ſhould and ſhall believe on him through the Apoſtles doctrine; this is not for the ſake of all men, that he ſo much as prepares to die, much leſſe that he died for them, for whom he fitted not himſelf to die in their behalf.</p>
            <p>So as you ſee to make up the harmony and conſent in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, you muſt (as on a muſicall inſtrument) not put on <hi>great ſtrings</hi> only, but the <hi>ſmaller alſo,</hi> and in a Conſort, take the <hi>Tenour</hi> and Counter-tenour with the <hi>Baſe:</hi> You muſt not only hearken to the loud noiſe of the <hi>world,</hi> and the ſound of <hi>all, all,</hi> &amp;c. but take in the ſmaller ſounds of <hi>ſheep</hi> and <hi>friends,</hi> and <hi>believers,</hi> and then, when we have the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures in a compleat harmony ſet together, they doe all unanimouſly make againſt univerſall Redemption, not for it.</p>
            <p>Behold the firſt Reaſon, is without an Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <label>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.</label> 
               <hi>If Chriſt did not die for all, every one could not have a ground of believing the report of the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> What, is there no ground of beleeving, but upon a falſe <hi>Alarme</hi> and <hi>Report,</hi> as this man hath brought amongſt you?</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Reaſon is the voice of unbelief; The Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Doctrine <hi>helpes a lame Dogge over the stile,</hi> viz. An unbeleeving heart to reaſon againſt the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all men are not bought and redeemed by Chriſt, therefore I muſt not beleeve. I ſay again, this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the language of unbeliefe, beware of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I retort it; To lay forth this Doctrine before car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, That Chriſt died for all, is to lay a ſtumbling block before the blinde, and to throw duſt in the <hi>eyes</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>Gods elect,</hi> that it ſhall not ſee at all, but live by ſenſe, and not by it's own principles, or not ſee by it's owne eyes. Beloved, in true beleeving there is a myſtery: When Chriſt dying for ſinners, is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the world, it is a ſelf-denying act to beleeve
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114102:25"/> in him, before I know I am of Gods ſecret number of the names in the Lambs book, for whom Chriſt died, but 'tis no ſelf-deniall, when I hear Chriſt died for all, to beleeve I am one. This Doctrine then is an enemy to true beleeving, and indeed, a falſe Doctrine (as I called it at firſt, and have ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it) can beget but a falſe faith, that which is but tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not to be nouriſhed or cheriſhed by any true teacher or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſer of the word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is there no <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>believing,</hi> except Chriſt died for all? I will name you a few (without this) and ſufficient, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to convince and draw a ſoul to believing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Propoſition,</hi> or true and faithfull ſaying, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Command, Believe,</hi> God bids thee believe; faith is obedience to the Command, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 26.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Promiſe; <hi>He that beleeveth ſhall not periſh,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. <hi>but he hath everlaſting life;</hi> Joh. 6. 47. <hi>and ſhall certainly be ſaved,</hi> Act. 16. 31.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Gods act of <hi>juſtifying</hi> the <hi>ungodly,</hi> Rom. 4. 5.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Gods raiſing Chriſt from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 21. conſult and ponder the places.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This very Propoſition, That Chriſt died but for ſome, namely, <hi>for his ſheep,</hi> hath been a ground of believing, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after much diſcourſe about his ſheep, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, the reſult and cloſe is, <hi>v.</hi> ult. <hi>And many beleeved on him there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Chriſt himſelf held forth (indefinitely) as a ſufficient, neceſſary, and only meane of ſalvation, which, who ſo belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <note place="margin">Ames. Anti. <hi>Synodatia.</hi> 188.</note> in, chuſeth and relieth upon (under that notion) may be ſure, that Chriſt hath an effectuall intention and purpoſe of ſaving him. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and others held forth Chriſt: <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified unto the Jews</hi> indeed (who will not ſee ſufficiency) <hi>a ſtumbling blocke; and unto the Greeks</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23, 24.</note> (who will not ſee the neceſſary determinations of Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom this way) <hi>fooliſhneſſe; But unto them which are called,</hi> perſwaded to hearken after a crucified Saviour, the ſufficiency, neceſſity, and ſole-ſoveraignty of his ſoul-ſaving bloud and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114102:25"/> 
               <hi>Christ the power of God, and the wiſdom of God;</hi> ſo we preach, ſo Gods elect do believe, though they know not at the firſt, whether they be of the number for whom Chriſt was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; Hence,</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, I anſwer, The firſt act of thy faith is not to beleeve Chriſt died for <hi>all,</hi> or for thee in particular (the one is not true, the other is not certain <hi>to thee,</hi> till thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveſt) but this is that thou art called unto, to believe in Chriſt, as dying for ſinners, and able and willing to ſave <hi>thee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> then when thou comeſt to reflect upon thy faith, thou ſhalt finde Chriſt died for thee; not one man or perſon (of years) more then other is included or excluded, but by his faith or unbelief.</p>
            <p>Behold again, his ſecond Reaſon without an Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> without nerves or ſinews of truth, to argue for this tenet of his, and of all unbeleevers in a practicall way: Let none then go away from ſuch a Lecture, and ſay, <hi>We were led into, and kept in errour all this time (for we were taught, that we must first know we were elected, before we ſhould beleeve; but now, that we hear Chriſt died for all, we ſee ground for beleeving)</hi> for it is as much as your ſouls are worth, to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry here, you may be loſt for ever upon this <hi>verticall point:</hi> For I deny, that Chriſts dying for all, or Gods electing of ſome, and the particular knowledge of it, is the foundation that we lay for mens beleeving; not the firſt, becauſe falſe; not the later, becauſe though it be moſt true, that God gave his Sonne for none but his elect; yet that thou ſhouldeſt know thy ſelf of the number before thou believeſt, who but ignorant men will teach ſo? who but ignorant hearts will think ſo? Election is a cauſe of beleeving, and <hi>ſo many as are ordained to life, have and ſhall believe,</hi> Act. 13. 48. And if men doe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally perſiſt in unbelief, it is a ſign they are not of Chriſts ſheep, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10 26.

               <label>Anſw.</label> I deny the Aſſumption, and the two proofs of it.</p>
            <p>The Aſſumption to be denied of you, beloved, as of my ſelf, is this, <hi>That Chriſt died for all that are called,</hi> tis a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption without any found proof: for</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt proof, <hi>Elſe they ſhould not have been called,</hi> is a <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> or a <hi>falſe conſequence,</hi> for <hi>many are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> becauſe among the <hi>many,</hi> God hath his choiſe number, and will one day more diſtinguiſh them (before all the world) then yet he doth, as in <hi>verſ.</hi> 47. The Parable following theſe of the Text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond proof proves not that it is brought for, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called they are bound to believe that which is true or falſe, and if Christ did not die for them and for all, they are bound to beleeve that which is falſe;</hi> thus he argued. And thus I anſwer, as to the ſecond of his Reaſons before; Every man that is called is bound to believe that which is true, <hi>viz. That Christ died for ſinners.</hi> Again, he is bound to believe in Chriſt for himſelf, though not for all others, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith:</hi> And again, all that are called hearing Chriſt died for ſome (even all comers) that is enough, though he knows not who are the particulars, it is his duty to yeeld obedience to Gods call; ſeeing he knows he is called, and when he hath obeyed that call, he may and ſhall know he is choſen, and that Chriſt died for him, ſo as this Argument, which hath a flouriſh from Scripture, and a ſhew of Reaſon, yet hath no ſolidity or truth of reaſon in it.</p>
            <p>His ſecond Argument was from 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>There is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of ſome that denied the Lord that bought them: now</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>ſure it was none of the elect that denied their Lord, therefore Chriſt bought more then the elect;</hi> thus he argued, and thus I diſarm his Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> 1. It is poſſible for a time, and in ſome act or word,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114102:26"/> or doctrine, even for the elect to deny their Lord; in a degree, did not <hi>Peter</hi> once, twice or thrice?</p>
            <p>2. It doth not follow, that though the Apoſtle may and doth ſpeak of ſome not-elected, Chriſt our Lord had bought more then the elect. No, you will ſay, it is affirmed expreſly, the Lord had <hi>bought them,</hi> upon whom was to come <hi>ſwift destruction,</hi> yea, but how were they <hi>bought,</hi> or are ſaid to be <hi>bought?</hi> not really and intentionally by the Lord, but in opinion of themſelves, or of others, by that profeſſion which they made for a time, as if Chriſt had died for them, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did not.</p>
            <p>It is a rule whereby you may underſtand other Scriptures as well as this, <hi>That is ſaid to be done, which is ſo reputed in a mans own, or others account or profeſſion,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. He that fals away from his whole profeſſion, is ſaid, <hi>to count the bloud of the Covenant wherewith he was ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified an unholy thing, ſanctified,</hi> that is, <hi>profeſſionally,</hi> and in <hi>opinion:</hi> So here.</p>
            <p>Hence I conclude this Argument alſo to be without truth of Scripture or ſtrength of Reaſon to make it good; and if it be ſaid, That ſuch as hold Chriſt died for none but the elect, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Lord that bought them and all the world, I ſhall pay them back in their own coyn, and poſitively ſtate it, that ſuch as teach, Chriſt died for more ſinners, then God eternally elected, <hi>Deny the Lord that choſe them,</hi> and ſo make a jarre between the ſweet ſtrings of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now followed him in his method, of Scriptures, Reaſons and Arguments, all invalid to prove what he deſired; The Scriptures alleadged as witneſſes, but falſly; the Reaſons without Argument, the Arguments without Reaſon; there were other Reaſons or Arguments ſcattered here and there, to amplifie his diſcourſe (before he came to the Uſes of his Doctrine) which I will briefly wipe away.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Let us examine the Conſequence; Doth it follow at all that becauſe we ſay the one, Chriſt <hi>died not for all,</hi> therefore we may ſay the other, that <hi>God made a people to damn them?</hi> He would indeed teach us to blaſpheme, but we will not learn of him.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Scripture tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf; yea even the wicked for the day of evil.</hi> He made them not wicked, but if men make themſelves wicked, God (who would not permit the

            <p n="2">2. Becauſe God will not loſe his elect, but purchaſe them at a dear rate, Is he bound to doe as much for others, as he freely doth for them? <hi>Who art thou that replieſt thus againſt God?</hi> as if becauſe man takes delight in ſinning, God ſhould take delight in meer damning; no, no, <hi>'Tis the ſinner cuts his own throat, and throws himſelf into the fire;</hi> and when upon offers and entreaties, the ſinner will not return and live, but ſinne and die, the mercifull God will ſhew no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; He that made them will ſhew them no favour, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. after his patience is abuſed, his mercie ſleighted, and his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bowels grieved; juſtice breaks forth, and fury ceaſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poor ſinner.</p>

            <p>This is a meer ſcandall they would caſt upon the true Goſpel, with the reſt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Conſ. 5. <hi>God will damn men (they hold) becauſe he will</hi>

               <hi>to justifie the devil, who taught</hi> Cain, <hi>and</hi> Julian, <hi>and</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra <hi>to despair, and</hi> Judas <hi>to hang himſelf; Now you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the devil to be a lier from the beginning, and that he cannot teach a truth, and on the contrary you will conclude, none ought to deſpair,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſ.</label> 1. It is a <hi>double reproach,</hi> either that this follows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſts dying for ſinners prae-elected; or that we hold, <hi>God will damn, becauſe he will damn;</hi> God can ſend his Son to die for, and ſave whom he pleaſeth, and yet doth not damn any but for ſin.</p>
            <p>2. If men ſinne againſt the Goſpel, and ſinne with that diſobedience, as to ſtumble, and fall too, into deſpair; it is of themſelves; not from Chriſt, or the Goſpel; but by accident. God ordaineth the Goſpel for ſalvation, and Chriſts death, for ſalvation; if man and devil agree to pervert the Scripture, to their damnation, 'tis the devils invention, and mans ordinance, not Gods.</p>
            <p>3. Yet this we ſay; That no <hi>devil</hi> ſhall <hi>teach</hi> a man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair (note by the way 'tis the <hi>devils doctrine,</hi> not ours) nor ſhall man voluntarily damn himſelf, againſt Gods over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling will and power, but with it, for the Scripture, ſo attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes the cauſe of damnation and deſpair to the creature, as yet it ſubordinates all this to the fore-appointment of God, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 8. Jude v. 4.</note> and ſuffer it ſo to be.</p>
            <p>And ſo you may conclude, That although none ought to deſpair, nor hath any warrant for it, from Chriſts dying but for ſome, or from any other Scripture-truth; yet if they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair (upon fleſhly, worldly and ſatanicall motions) God will order it to his glory.</p>

            <p n="2">2.

            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> I demand whom he means by <hi>[us]</hi> if the people of God, and the elect, and believers; how is this a direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, from Chriſts buying the whole world? if all men, be meant by <hi>us,</hi> how ſhall they love, who doe not believe? but if he underſtood Gods peculiar people; becauſe he mention'd the Spouſe afterwards <hi>[no wonder her love is ſo carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her espouſed husband Chriſt]</hi> let him know that the hearts of the Saints are touched and taken with the ſpeciall love of Chriſt; it is that which conſtrains them to love him in a ſpeciall manner, and that the more abundantly, becauſe they know in part, and ſhall yet further know, Chriſt died for <hi>them,</hi> not only out of a generall love which he bears to mans <hi>nature;</hi> but out of a <hi>speciall and ſingular love,</hi> which he bears to <hi>their perſons,</hi> and to <hi>theirs onely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have we followed his Counſell to ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and we finde them of weight, for ſpeciall Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and love, but weighing the man, and his Doctrine, and Uſes too, of univerſall Redemption, we have found them too light.</p>
            <p>Let me but adde a few Arguments, as Antidotes (againſt the poyſon, which ſome of you, may have ſuck't in of late) and preſervatives from the infection of this hereticall tenet, of Chriſts buying the world of men, and dying for them all;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114102:32"/> and we have done with the <hi>Anaſceuastique</hi> part of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which tends to the weakning, ruine and deſtruction, <note place="margin">Antidotes or Counter poiſon</note> of ſo grand an errour.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Gods Attributes</hi> are hereby wronged and ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Gods power is called into Queſtion;</hi> as if a generall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit were merited by Chriſt, which by reaſon of mans wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he cannot apply.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His wiſdome is eclipſed,</hi> for it puts upon him ſuch an intention, as yet by proper and direct means he attains not unto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>His juſtice is rendered unjuſt;</hi> for he receiveth a full ſatisfaction, of his Sonne, for all men; and yet neither firſt nor laſt, receiveth them into the favour of communion and friendſhip.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>His higheſt love is undervalued;</hi> for it holds forth Gods love to give his Sonne, but not ſo, as to give <hi>them</hi> faith, <hi>for whom</hi> he gave his Sonne; and it ſpeaks of Chriſts ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dying for <hi>them, whom</hi> yet he lets die and periſh in their ſins.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If he died for all, then he died in their ſtead, and as their ſurety he diſcharged the whole debt, and ſo, it is not only unjuſt, but impoſſible, that any ſhould periſh; here the Remonſtrants <hi>(Arminians</hi> ſo calling themſelves) at the <hi>Hague</hi> conference, had a ſubtle diſtinction of Chriſts dying, <hi>Non loco &amp; vice omnium,</hi> not in the room and ſtead of all, <hi>ſed bono tantum;</hi> but for their good only, whereas the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures (which own not ſuch a diſtinction) hold out Chriſt as dying in the room and ſtead of ſinners, that they might not die eternally, but live for ever, ſo is, <note n="a" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, If he died for all, he roſe again for all, aſcended, ſits at Gods right-hand, and makes interceſſion for all; for the Scriptures joyn his death and reſurrection together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. ult. and his death, aſcenſion, ſitting, interceding with the Father, all together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. and more particularly with his interceſſion, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. and if ſo; that he riſeth, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth, ſits and pleads for all; he is, either heard, or not heard for all; if heard for all, then all muſt be ſaved; if not heard for all, then Chriſt intercedeth in vain; and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth not hear him alwaies, croſſe to Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 42.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This looſe opinion, puts all that hold it, upon ſuch <hi>diſtinctions,</hi> as have no ground from Scripture, but are contrary to it; as</p>
            <p n="1">1. That (but even now named, or refuted) of <hi>loco</hi> and <hi>bono,</hi> not <hi>in ſtead</hi> of all, but for the <hi>good</hi> of all.</p>

            <p n="3">3. That of Chriſts <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for all men, and obtaining the <hi>pardon</hi> of all ſinnes againſt the <hi>Covenant of works</hi> for all them, and his ſatisfaction for, and pardon of the ſinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> only for the elect; whereas all men originally and actually hanging upon a Covenant of works, for life, and yet continually breaking that Covenant, are actually in all ages, and in this preſent age (as in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles age) under the curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5. It makes Chriſts <hi>death</hi> not at all the <hi>execution</hi> of Gods election; or if at all; but of a <hi>conditionall election,</hi> producing but a <hi>conditionall Redemption</hi> for all, not <hi>abſolute</hi> for any; hence</p>
            <p n="6">6. It frames <hi>Gods intention</hi> after <hi>mans fancy,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts love</hi> to be no more to <hi>Peter,</hi> then to <hi>Iudas,</hi> as ſome have confeſt it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It imagines the <hi>grace</hi> of God to be <hi>for all,</hi> or <hi>none,</hi> and Chriſts death to be for none <hi>certainly,</hi> but <hi>contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. It ſhuts out <hi>Infants</hi> from any <hi>benefit</hi> by Chriſts death, but what (ſay they) is <hi>common</hi> to Reprobates, as <hi>freedome from originall ſinne; bodily life and Reſurrection:</hi> The firſt we deny that any Reprobate hath, or ſhall have; As for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, and <hi>future Reſurrection,</hi> if Infants have no more advantage by Chriſts death; then have they not ſo much; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a benefit, or not, as by his death; if they have more; why do the Aſſertours of ſuch grace, deny them the ſeal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in Baptiſme?</p>
            <p n="9">9. It leads to other errours, as pernitious and peſtilent; I'le inſtance in three,</p>
            <p>1. That of <hi>free will;</hi> for Chriſts death for all, obtains but of God (by their Doctrine) a poſſibility that men may be ſaved, converted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they <hi>will;</hi> and that <hi>will</hi> left in their common <hi>Nature,</hi> is <hi>Grace; Goſpel-grace</hi> they muſt

            </p>

Now this is one means of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers glory, as a fruit of his glorification, the gift of eternall life, to as many as God had given him; which eternall life begins in the knowledge of the true God, even in thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and Heathens who had worſhipped the creature, in ſtead of the Creatour; and never would come to the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, but by the knowledge of Chriſt; Chriſt is not to be made known to the Gentiles, till he be glorified, he praieth therefore that he be glorified, that the knowledge of God in him, ſent of God, might be diſpoſed, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. So as they who never knew God, might know him right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſavingly; and what is this? or how is this? but by the infuſion of faith; hence to know God in Chriſt, and to believe in God through Chriſt, from the very firſt act,

Let ſuch a call be for ever called a diſpenſation of goodneſſe and juſtice, not a diſcovery of grace and Chriſt, when it is not ſo; and let ſuch as had but the creatures, and common providence to help them, be none of Gods called, but rejected and neglected, not <hi>comparatè,</hi> but <hi>abſolutè.</hi>

All this ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that men living under Goſpel-diſpenſations, are led by a divine providence to look after Goſpel-repentance; but it proves not that, for which <hi>Teſtardus</hi> alledgeth the Apoſtle, that the men of former ages, before the Goſpel came among the Gentiles had ſome call to Chriſt and grace, agreeable to the common call, which now men have by the Word and Spirit.</p>

            <p>In theſe two Parables (as in all ſimilitudes) there are two parts,

            <p>Firſt, of a <hi>Treaſure</hi> hid and found, and hid again, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, and purchaſed by him that found it, with all that he had.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The Reddition, ſo is the <hi>Kingdom of heaven,</hi> as is a Treaſure and Pearl in the diſcovery and purchaſe of it; ſo is the Kingdom; or the <hi>Kingdom of heaven is like unto,</hi> &amp;c. that is, there is that worth in it, and that tranſaction and management of affairs about it, as if a man ſhould finde a treaſure in a <hi>field,</hi> or ſeeking many pearls, he ſhould finde one of great price, and having found this Treaſure, this Pearl, he goeth and ſelleth all that he hath, and buyeth it.</p>
            <p>By the Kingdome of heaven, I underſtand, the State and Treaſure of it, with the affairs and dealings about it; or Chriſt and his grace preached and ſet forth in the Goſpel of grace, and in Goſpel diſpenſations; Chriſt and his Goſpel grace and diſpenſations, were ſet out in the four fore-going Parables; by their nature, force and efficacy; here, by their worth and ſtate of excellency with the Chriſtians affairs and dealings for his enjoyments of all the worth and treaſure of the Kingdom, as his own.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:114102:66"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>riches of the Kingdom</hi> reſembled to hidden <hi>treaſure,</hi> and a precious <hi>pearl;</hi> what elſe is it, but Chriſt and his <hi>Goſpel-grace?</hi> as may appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By parallel expreſſions and deſcriptions of him and his <hi>grace</hi> in Scripture; Such as you read of in <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Things above, where Chriſt ſitteth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Treaſure in heaven, Math.</hi> 19. 21. &amp; 5. 21. <hi>This treaſure,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 7. <hi>viz.</hi> of Chriſt and the Goſpel-knowledge of him, <hi>v.</hi> 6. The people of God are the children of the Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 38. and the ſubjects of the Kingdom, yea heirs and co-heirs with Chriſt, that is enough for them, but they are not <hi>the treaſure</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> Chriſt is <hi>that treaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By the Characters given to this treaſure of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in the Parables of the Text, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. We hear here of a hidden <hi>Treaſure,</hi> Chriſt is moſt like to a hidden Treaſure, as being furtheſt off from the knowledge of men; you may know a viſible Church, ſooner then the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God and Saviour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hid in a field,</hi> that is, a field by it ſelf, and a large field, yet diſtinctly and particularly bounded, within the Word and Ordinances of grace; there is Chriſt hid and wrapt up, in precious promiſes, the preaching and ſubſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is called, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>The word of the Kingdome;</hi> for where the Treaſure is found, there it was firſt hidden; in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel promiſes, Ordinances and diſpenſations, Chriſt and his grace is found.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is mention of a <hi>Pearl,</hi> and <hi>one of great price;</hi> Chriſt is that Pearl, with the grace of the Goſpel; of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, invaluable price; it will impoveriſh every man that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to buy it, but when he hath ſold all, to his ſhirt and skin for it, it enricheth him for ever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>One Pearl,</hi> which can agree to none but Chriſt, and the unſearchable worth of his grace and Goſpel, ſet in oppoſition to all the goodly pearls, in mens eſteem, the ſuppoſed <hi>mediums</hi> of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what the ſtate and worth of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven is, and to what it is like; it is Chriſt,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114102:67"/> and <hi>all he is worth,</hi> like to a <hi>Treaſure,</hi> and <hi>one Pearl, of great price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to conſider the Kingdome of heaven, in it's affairs; and the Chriſtians dealings about it, <hi>like to a man</hi> that findeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who is he that findeth? he that ſeeketh, and who is he that ſeeketh? the <hi>merchant man,</hi> a man of no ſmall dealings in the world.</p>
            <p>The <hi>merchant man</hi> is every elect-veſſel of mercy; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented here under a double notion.

Is it a baſe luſt, or a carnal contentment? Some profitable bargain in the world, or pleaſurable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this earth? Dare you ſay, that Chriſt weigheth not down all the world? Worth you ſee in Chriſt, nothing but unworthineſſe in ſin; no merit or worth in the creature, why conſider Chriſt is of more worth then all his benefits and graces (conferred on us) and yet any of his graces and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual benefits are of more worth (as they have the love of God, and the ſtamp of Chriſt upon them) then all the world, and all wordly accommodations, not to be named the ſame day with the leaſt of Chriſts graces, much leſſe to be weighed in the ſame balance with Chriſt himſelf. On the great ſin of thoſe then who prefer their ſwiniſh luſts, and carnal profits, before this treaſure; and the brutiſhnes of thoſe, who prefer the traſh on this worldly dunghill, before a Pearl, this <hi>Pearl</hi> of <hi>great price.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, Beleeve we this fulneſſe of Chriſt, and Goſpel-grace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and beleeve in it. 1. Beleeve there is ſuch a <hi>Treaſure,</hi> though you have not experimentally found it. The <hi>Report</hi> hereof muſt be <hi>bleeved,</hi> or the <hi>arm of God</hi> will not be <hi>revealed</hi> to bring you in, to the <hi>Treaſure,</hi> or the <hi>Treaſure</hi> to you.

Beleeve in it.

            <p>Secondly, Eſteem we this <hi>Treaſure</hi> and <hi>Pearl</hi> at it's full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> rate and value: A Treaſure it is, a Kings Treaſure, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms treaſure, an heavenly treaſure, an hidden treaſure, made up in a Pearl, one Pearl; all which call for our high eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and account of it. 1. As 'tis a Treaſure: who doth not prize a treaſure wherein there is abundance? <hi>Joſeph's</hi> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance drew his brethren highly to prize him, whom before
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114102:74"/> they had ſlighted; <hi>Solomons</hi> treaſures of wiſdom, as of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, raiſed his fame in all parts, brought over the Queen of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> to ſee and admire, till ſhe had no more ſpirit in her; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a greater then Solomon is here,</hi> to be valued for his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and wealth above ten thouſand <hi>Solomons.</hi> 2. Here is the Kings treaſure; a Kings treaſure is (and it is fit it ſhould be) greater then that of any particular Subject; and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the King of Kings (to whom all earthly Kings muſt vale and ſtoop, and ſhould willingly ſwear homage and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection) muſt needs be infinitely above the wealth of any of <hi>his Subjects,</hi> though they be <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Monarchs</hi> here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. 3. The Kingdoms treaſure is of greater worth, then the particular revenues of the King: for as the King is, ſo is his treaſure, though <hi>ſingulis major,</hi> over and above all indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, yet <hi>univerſis minor,</hi> leſſe then the publike: Behold, the Kingdoms treaſure is here for you, yea, the <hi>King</hi> himſelf is his Kingdoms <hi>treaſure,</hi> and his Subjects <hi>Pearl.</hi> 4. What Kingdom but that of heaven? What treaſure is it but an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly? To be prized above all the treaſures of the earth, and earthly Kingdoms put together; take the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> treaſures, the wealth of all the Princes and ſtates of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> with all the Indian gold and jewels: Summe all up, they are all but Ciphers, without a figure, they come all to nothing, nothing but vanity and winde; all earthly treaſure is but traſh and dirt from beneath; the treaſure of our text is from above, that may be loſt, ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, this no thief can break thorow and ſteal; that is but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible at the beſt, this incorruptible and fadeth not away. 5. 'Tis an hidden <note n="d" place="margin">

There is more then yet can be found, and that which is found, is more then can be told over; 'tis the love of Chriſt that paſſeth knowledge, and the merit of Chriſt, that paſſeth all price and worth in the creature; and ſurpaſſeth all the valuation and eſteem you can give it; ſet it as high <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114102:75"/> 6. All this treaſure is made up in one <hi>Pearl of great price,</hi> and that with God, why ſhould it not be ſo with us? The richeſt Pearl that ever I read of, was that which <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> diſſolved and drunk in a health to <hi>Antonius</hi> her friend, worth a hundred thouſand gold pieces; What if the price had been a hundred millions, or a million of millions? this is but mans price, and in mans market, who value things, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jewels and pearls, more according to fancy, then true worth; but God himſelf here ſets the price, beyond what you can reckon it at; yet if you like it, you ſhall have it at an under-rate; have but theſe thoughts of it; it is ſurely worth all that I have, or that any man hath of his own; and that the merchant man was no fool to go and ſell all that he had to buy it; of which in it's due place.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Pity we thoſe who know nothing of it, and it's worth, and make we the beſt diſcovery of it we can: Let the Miniſters of the Lord, and people of God; let all Chriſts factours, who have any trading and commerce with heaven, ſet forth the excellency and the worth hereof (after <hi>Pauls</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern in every Epiſtle of his) to the life, and to the luſtre and glory of it, that poor earth wormes, and ignorant ſoules may may be taken with it's commendations, and drawn to dig and ſearch for it, where it is to be found.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Seek we for it, and more of it, where it is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in Scripture-promiſes, and Goſpel-Sermons; give that choice field its due account, and wait for the opening of the field, the treaſure, and your hearts together; to underſtand more of the myſtery of Jeſus Chriſt; Suſpect thoſe who would lead you from the <hi>Field,</hi> where you may finde the <hi>Treaſure;</hi> yea, conclude they are deceivers, who call into Queſtion the whole written text of Scripture. And take but this Antidote or two along with you, when you are tempted to ſip of ſuch a cup of poiſon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe are the Scriptures, and written Word of God, where Chriſt and his grace is to be ſought and found, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. in the preſent Scriptures Chriſt is found, and eternall life is found in his words, by us <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and when the <hi>Iew</hi> ſhall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114102:75"/> turn to the Lord, the vail ſhall be taken away (which now is upon their heart in the reading of the old Teſtament) and they ſhall finde this treaſure alſo with us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are the true Expoſitours of Scripture, and the right Expoſitions, which hold forth Chriſt and Gods free grace in him, <hi>Yesterday, to day, and for ever,</hi> ſo as they give nothing to nature, or the creature at all; which they doe, who lay all the ground of Baptiſme upon mans act, not Gods promiſe, and who by preaching Chriſts death for all, leave it to the contingency of the creatures <hi>ſlippery-ſlaviſh will,</hi> to vote it, whether this or that man, or any man ſhall be ſaved or no?</p>
            <p>I come to a ſecond obſervation,</p>

            </p>
            <p>So much, I conceive is taught us by our Lord, in that he ſaith, the merchant man who at laſt findes the true pearl of the Kingdome, is in his firſt ſeekings buſied (with other men) <note place="margin">Proved.</note> about ſuppoſed ſpecious pearls, which men may ſet a price upon, but here is no price put upon them by Chriſt. <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Many</hi> (even the elect a while, with others, till their hearts be touched, as <hi>Davids</hi> was) are enquiring, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> If it be but a ſhew of <hi>good,</hi> it ſhall they think, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them. <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 6. 32.</note>

            <p>I ſhall further make out the truth hereof in a few Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, that it is ſo, and why it is ſo.</p>

            <p n="1">1. All men have a natural aim at happineſſe; and they who live under the preaching of the Word, they aim at ſuch a place as is called heaven; for the will naturally hath good for its object, and enclines to chuſe a <hi>ſum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Mediums</hi> and waies men have (though falſe) as ſo many pearls in their eye, fair and goodly poſſibilities to keep them from miſery, and to make them happy: ſuch a carnal pleaſure, as the Epicure, or ſuch a portion of eſtate, as the rich fool in the Goſpel; ſuch honour at Court, or preferment at, or by the Parliament; ſome are for profound learning, and travels in the writings of the Ancients; others for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon parts, or trades and imploiments in the City or Countrey; ſome for Philoſophy and phyſick, others for Rhetorick or muſick; ſome for common graces, others for religious duties and offices in the Church, by ſome or any of theſe, men take their aim at a bleſſed ſtate for preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture too.</p>

The wiſeſt Philoſophers at
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114102:76"/> 
               <hi>Athens</hi> (that famous Heathen Univerſity) might happily feel and grope after God, as men in the dark, but higher and nearer they could not come, then to dedicate an Altar, <note n="i" place="margin">Act. 17. 23.</note> 
               <hi>To the unknown God;</hi> And why was God unknown? becauſe Chriſt was unknown; Now while the elect at <hi>Athens</hi> (as elſwhere) are ignorant of Chriſt, they ſeek, but finde not; ſomething they would have (like children) but they know not what, or by what way and mean to compaſſe their deſires.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The deceit of mens underſtandings</hi> which repreſent an apparent and ſeeming good for the will to faſten upon; any thing rather then the right mean and way of happineſſe; pleaſures, luſts, rather then Chriſt. The <note n="k" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 22.</note> 
               <hi>old man</hi> is full of <hi>deceitfull lusts,</hi> and the old mans reaſonings are very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and crafty, which, for a long time (and if God be not mercifull, for ever) do keep the ſoul in purſuit of that which is imaginary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The pride of the will</hi> is ſuch, that every one would be happy in himſelf, Men are naturally poor and proud; every one will be a <hi>Merchant</hi> (without a ſtock) trading and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and doing (a ſuppoſed) ſomething to contribute to his own happineſſe. As it was an ingredient in the firſt ſinne, that we would be as Gods; to when Chriſt is diſcovered (as well, yea more, as when he is not) we would be as Chriſts: We would finde that in ſelf and creature, which is not to be found, but in Chriſt; And if Chriſt be a <hi>Pearl,</hi> we will have a pearl or two beſides him, or with him; As ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Papiſts, we would have our goodly Saviours and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours, beſides, and with him, and ſo we miſſe of him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together at the laſt, and finde him not ſavingly at all, while we are of that minde, and be determin'd by the caſting vote of our own will.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The vanity of the creature,</hi> which affords nothing but reſtleſſe diſappointments; when <hi>one pearl</hi> is needfull and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, the vain minde of man, not content with <hi>one thing,</hi> deſirous of <hi>many,</hi> runs out upon the creature, flutters here there, findes unſatisfactorineſſe in all things here below, is

If upon apprehenſion of Chriſt, and Goſpel-promiſes, the ſoul fals into a deſpondency, and a kinde of deſpair, ever to have it made ſure unto it's ſelf; if there be no hope, there is certainly no faith. As hope before faith is a preſumptuous carriage of a mans ſpirit, ſo deſpairing after faith is an odde and croſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, a contradiction indeed unto the Goſpel, and all

If ſuch be looſe and ſlippery in their purpoſes of making out for Chriſt, where is thy faith? There is no faith in that heart, where there is not a deſire of more; no finding of Chriſt where you are not reſolved to buy, and get him in for your own, more certainly and comfortably, then at the firſt.</p>

Beware of a bad hiding of Chriſt (while you take care to expreſſe your faith in this humble, hopefull, loving and wiſe way of hiding him) take heed of ſmoothering or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing what God hath diſcovered to you of Chriſt and his promiſes, and free-grace, for ſo you may diſhonour God, and wrong your ſoul, and quench and hinder that good in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which you are bound to ſeek, when you have found the treaſure; when the Diſciples <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 1 41, 43, 45.</note> had found Chriſt, they went and told it one another; when the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 4. 28, 29.</note> had found Chriſt, ſhe went and told it her neighbours; when <hi>Zacheus</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 19. 8.</note> had found Chriſt, he ſtood forth, in the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his faith and repentance, and in the proof of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; when <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 9. 20.</note> had found Chriſt, he went and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to others (as he was called to it) ſo let every one, as he hath been prevented by grace, prevent others, and tell them what God hath taught him; but in thy knowledge or diſcovery of Chriſt,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beware of boaſting in thy ſelf, or of being lifted up in deſires of thy own glory or worth; beware of a proud pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or of proud exceptions againſt Chriſt; take heed, when Chriſts worth is diſcovered to thee, thou doſt not look out for worth in thy ſelf, to apply the promiſes, as too many weak ſouls doe, and will not, dare not beleeve, becauſe of unworthineſſe; they are not rich enough to buy the pearl, nor good enough to purchaſers of the treaſure: what pride is here
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114102:87"/> under a beggars coat? Cheriſh thou ſhouldſt all mean and low thoughts of thy ſelf, the more freely God doth manifeſt his grace unto thee; but attribute all the worth to the treaſure; there is worth enough in that, thou ſhalt need none of thy own, God requires it not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Beware of entertaining doubts and queſtions, whether you may have Chriſt, after you have found him. Wherefore did God diſcover him? was it not that you ſhould beleeve? and beleeve yet further in his name, upon new diſcoveries? Let not the ſubtle ſerpent, and the deceitfull heart together, cheriſh a ſubtle-humble-pride, in queſtioning and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to weaken thy hopes of obtaining that which is revealed in the promiſe to thee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Beware of loſing your firſt-love of the Goſpel; and your firſt eſteem of this <hi>Treaſure</hi> and <hi>Pearl,</hi> with the <hi>field</hi> of precious promiſes: 'tis not ſo eaſily recovered again, when but left, or decaied. Why ſhould not our loves and eſteems be more now, then at firſt, ſeeing more of Chriſts worth and and ſufficiency is diſcovered daily? And yet thou nor I did ever hear or know of half his worth, which is further to be revealed. Get we therefore more high and capacious appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of his excellency, and hide we him in our boſome, with dearer affections then ever; he is worthy of all our love, of all our eſtimations and higheſt value, we can prize him at; he is above all we can love, or beleeve, or eſteem, or thinke of him: Get we an eſtimation of him, and affection to him, beyond expreſſion, that ſtill there may be more hidden in our hearts, then can be uttered by our tongues, or publiſhed by our pens.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Having found Chriſt, hold him faſt; hide him in your purpoſes, yet more cloſely and ſtrongly; it was <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhortation <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114102:87"/> fits and moods of beleeving, let but there be the hidden frame of beleeving, ſet and reſolved to keep the heart cloſe to Chriſt, and Chriſt cloſe to the heart, daily, hourly, conſtantly. Lay him and the promiſes up in the heart for uſe; for a treaſure of ſuch worth, a pearl of ſuch price, is much more worthy and precious to the ſoul, as it is uſed and improved for it's ſpirituall advantage. It followeth,</p>

            <p>When Chriſt hath prevented <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and <hi>Zacheus</hi> at that inſtant is called effectually to beleeve in the <hi>Lord, He recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Chriſt joyfully</hi> (ſaith the Text <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 19. 6.</note>) both into his heart, and into his houſe.

It is an unſpeakable and glorious treaſure that is found by every true beleever, the very ſight of it by faith, cannot but raviſh the heart, and might (were it narrowly viewed) tranſport it into an extaſie of joy: 'tis no common favour, nor ordinary, but rare and extraordinary, to finde a treaſure hid in a field; And as for this treaſure, few there be that finde it: As there is no other pearl of pearls, but Jeſus Chriſt; ſo none but elect veſſels of mercy doe finde him, contain or hold him; Well may every ſuch ſoul rejoyce; He that findes a treaſure, out of which he hath ſufficient to pay all his debts, and to ſtock him for trading, with the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, See from hence one reaſon, why Satan is ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to true joy: He knows well enough it would put thee upon mortification, and heavenly-mindedneſſe, and holy-reformation, and poverty of ſpirit; he keeps Chriſtians
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:114102:98"/> therefore, what he can, and as long as he can, from <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing</hi> in <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and from taking out the ſweet of that they have found, becauſe he would keepe their corruptions the ſtronger, and ſtave them off from a more aſſured purchaſe of the pearl and treaſure the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we may hence learn in what order mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and full ſelf-deniall comes forth, and is acted and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, upon, and after the joy of faith; after a ſoul hath found Chriſt, and conceived ſome ſweetneſſe in him, by beleeving: There are many who thinke, they muſt firſt <hi>ſell all,</hi> mortifie their luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then come to Chriſt by faith: no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant have they to beleeve, no ground of applying a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, till they have got ſuch maſtery, and victory over their luſts, as they deſire. And it may be, this is the ground and reaſon why ſome have put forth ſuch an ignorant Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion as this, what have we (even we beleevers) to ſell? as if all were done before faith, not after; whereas all is done (in true ſelf-deniall) with, and after the firſt beleeving; nothing before.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Let me give the true Chriſtian his portion; it is more comfort to finde thy joy to be <hi>true joy,</hi> then to finde thy heart meerly joyfull. Now then it is true, when it hath ſuch ſtrength as to bring in <hi>univerſall ſelf-deniall;</hi> when it hath that free royall nature, as to deny God nothing that he cals for; when it hath that purity, as to make thee ſtudious and carefull to pleaſe God, and come up to terms of agreement and commerce with him; If it be a means to mortifie ſinne, to crucifie thee to the world, and the world to thee (as it was to <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Gal 6. 14.</note>, his glorying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the croſſe of Chriſt, brought him to ſuch a frame) then is it a true joy, and a ſanctified fruit of the Spirit; <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,</hi> &amp;c. And when goodneſſe, meekneſſe, temperance, and other
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:114102:98"/> gracious acts, are the reſults of joy, it cannot be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but thy joy is ſound, and thy ſaith ſound, and thou haſt truly found the Treaſure; the <hi>Treaſure</hi> is thine, the <hi>Pearl</hi> thine, Chriſt, and all his excellencies are for thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Secondly, If thy joyes and enlargements of heart, have no other fruit, but ſelf-indulgence, and favour to thy luſt, and baſe yeelding to the next temptation; they are too weak to be the birth and of-ſpring of the Spirit; <hi>Self-ſeeking joy</hi> is too low and too baſe, to be born from on high; now to be ſure, all a worldlings joy is no other, all a carnall and formall profeſſours joy is no other. <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt gladly, but could not deny himſelf in his <hi>Herodias;</hi> the temporary beleever, ſet out by the ſtony ground, heard with joy, but when it came to the point of ſelf and world-denial, he fals away.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If ſelf-denial be but ſmall, 'tis a ſigne a Chriſtians joy is ſmall, and faith is but weak, at the beſt; yea, it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth againſt ſome profeſſours, that they have loſt their firſt joy, and their firſt love; time was when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to ſell a husband, a wife, a childe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now ſuch ſelf-relations are too near, too dear; Oh, the troubles of a wives or husbands loſſe muſt not be ſpoken of, nor the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a childe thought of; what is the reaſon? The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a Pearl in their eye, above and before Chriſt, and his truth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If thy joy be in thy parts and gifts, and outward duties, thy enlargements and priviledges among Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as matter of juſtification and righteouſneſſe before God; this joy would be turned into ſorrow and humiliation; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for <hi>ſuch a joy,</hi> will be a better evidence for thee (in it's proper place) then the cheriſhing of <hi>that,</hi> which is but a Phariſees, and a carnal mars joy: And although there is a proper comfort which flowes from true ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or inherent graces and duties of new obedience (as evidences of juſtification, and union with Chriſt) yet no further doe they comfort, or are they evidences, but as fruits
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:114102:99"/> of faith, and influences from the life and ſtrength of Chriſt. Look to it, that thy joy in duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not a joy in thy ſelf; but a joy of the <hi>Pearl</hi> and <hi>Treaſure,</hi> and the <hi>faith thereof;</hi> Joy in ſelf, and <hi>joy in Chriſt,</hi> are hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall, and of a contrary root and principle; And the <hi>later</hi> will and muſt (if the heart be upright) eat out, and conſume the former.</p>

            <p>For the clearing and proving whereof, how it is grounded and raiſed upon theſe Parables of ſelling and buying, and how conſonant to the truth of Scripture and reaſon; I ſhall open the ſimilitude that doth illuſtrate this truth, and ſo farre as it is the ſcope of the Parables, prove it; and then by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations ſhew and confirm that it is ſo, and why it muſt needs be ſo.</p>
            <p>In the metaphor of buying, we have <note place="margin">Cleared from the metaphor of buying.</note> conſiderable, 1. The act. 2. The object.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In the act of buying there are four things obvious, whereby it will appear, that as the merchant mans buying is here ſet forth as a conſequent of his ſelling, ſo diligence unto more full aſſurance, and clear evidence of Chriſt, is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and fruit of ſelf-denial.</p>
            <p>1. In buying, men lay out with coſt of money, much pains and diligence; it coſt the former and trades-man many a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:114102:100"/> trudging journey to fairs and markets; and the merchant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a walk up and down the City, and riding from town to town in the Countrey, yea, many a hazardable voyage by, and beyond the Seas: So the ſelf-denying Chriſtian, he laieth out much coſt of pains and diligence to make his calling and his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure. A ſure intereſt is that the earthly and heavenly merchant labours for. There is a two-fold intereſt in, and to the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
            <p>1. That which comes in by calling, this is the finding of the treaſure and pearl.</p>
            <p>2. That which was given the elect from all eternity, the knowledge whereof is the effect of calling, according to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; Now by thorow-ſelf-denial a ſoul is put to diligence, and by diligence ſeeks the knowledge of both theſe intereſts. But here is the difference between worldly and ſpirituall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing; the more money a man hath, the more he can carry on his trade, and merchandize in the world; but the leſſe worth a Chriſtian man hath, the more rich the merchant; when he comes without money or moneys price, he laieth out the more coſt: The more ſelf-denial in the heart, and the more empty the purſe of the ſoul is, the more diligence the Chriſtian giveth to attain what he beleeveth and hopeth for. And that a ſelf-denying ſoul, is ſuch a painfull diligent ſoul, is implied in that precept, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. &amp; 6. <hi>Buying</hi> with an <hi>empty</hi> purſe, is <hi>labouring,</hi> uſing the means, <hi>ſeeking</hi> in the Ordinances, by faith, hope, humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the ſenſe of our nothingneſſe, to truſt into God, and wait upon him for all in Chriſt. And it is ſo expreſſely found true in the practice of beleevers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 27. <hi>Behold, we have forſaken all, and have followed thee;</hi> here is diligent following of Chriſt, after negligent forſaking of a mans ſelf, and of all he hath; So S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> having ſuffered the loſſe of <hi>all</hi> to <hi>winne Chriſt,</hi> what are his deſires? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>That I may know him</hi> more experimentally; and his diligence, what is it? <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>If by any means I might attain,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>I follow after,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>reaching forwards,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>I preſſe toward the mark;</hi> the like diligence he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth

            <p>2. The Merchant by his buying and trafficking, obtains what he laieth out his coſt for: He that buyeth land, takes up land: He that buyeth a houſe takes livery and ſeiſin; 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to him by waies of ſtrong aſſurance; he that buyeth a commodity at market, carrieth it away with him from the ſhop, and brings it home: So he that by ſelf denyal gives di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, in the way of diligence, obtaineth what he ſeeketh for, the <hi>Treaſure, the Pearl</hi> Chriſt and Goſpel-grace; he gets ſure hold of it, and ſurer hopes of the enjoyment of it; in a graduall way, or by certain degrees; now ſome aſſurance, anon more, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 29. <hi>Every one that hath forſaken houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my names ſake, ſhall receive a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold,</hi> of heavenly aſſurance, <hi>and ſhall inherit,</hi> what he is aſſured of, <hi>everlasting life,</hi> Heb. 6. 12. with 10. and 11. <hi>v.</hi> They that laboured with <hi>faith and patience inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>followers of them,</hi> in <hi>the ſame diligence</hi> come to the <hi>ſame full aſſurance of hope,</hi> that they ſhall have the ſame inheritance.</p>
            <p>3. When the field, treaſure and pearl is bought, there is a <hi>knowledge</hi> of the mans and merchants <hi>propriety,</hi> and title to be good, having bought it in a legall way: So the ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligent Chriſtian, obtaining in a Goſpel-way of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, what he gives diligence for, can ſay, this is mine, for I bought it upon ſuch and ſuch lawfull terms.

            </p>
            <p>4. What is lawfully bought, may be, and is lawfully held, kept, and for ever poſſeſt, againſt all the cheats and challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of others: So the Chriſtian merchant, hath, by this his ſelf-denying diligence, ſuch a ſtrong and firm title given him, that none ſhall cheat him, or deprive him of it.

If you would have your aſſurance of Chriſt, and hold it to the end, beware of ſins againſt light, and ſins againſt profeſſion. Let careleſſe Chriſtians thinke or boaſt what they will of aſſurance. He that ſhall fall, and fall again into ſinne careleſly: So many acts of ſin, ſo many ſteps down to hell, ſo many degrees of Apoſtacy, all which will weaken and darken aſſurance; for, 1. Though ſin will not weaken Gods grounds, yet it will weaken our apprehenſion of thoſe grounds. 2. Though the light be clear in the Word, yet there is ſomething before our eye, the miſt of ſin, that we cannot ſee the Sun-beams of aſſurance. 3. Although theſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:114102:106"/> Sun-beams can, and will diſpell theſe miſts, yet God hath not promiſed to let them break forth, but as the heart breaketh for and from iniquity.</p>

               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> no bar, nor obſtacle, nor cloud in your way.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let there be diligence in heart-examination and hearty trial, and that in, and about theſe three things, 1. What you
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114102:106"/> have of Chriſt, whereto you have attained. 2. What you have ſold, and are yet to <hi>ſell,</hi> of ſelf and creature. 3. What you are yet to <hi>buy;</hi> what coſt to lay out for more aſſurance, evidence and peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Shew</hi> your diligence, as well as uſe it. The word there in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 11. is emphatical; diſplay your ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, your colours; let your diligence be ſuch as may break out and manifeſt it ſelf; and according to the metaphor in the Text, Doe as buyers, goe to the owner, goe to the Market.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Goe to the owner, own the owner of the field, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and pearl profeſſedly; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Jeweller, and Maſter of the Jewel-houſe in heaven; who deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, who ſelleth for himſelf and his Father too; <hi>Stand forth,</hi> as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did; take him into your Families, ſpeak, act for him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Goe to the mart and market of ordinances, private, publike. Your moſt common markets for buying more of the treaſure and pearl, will be praier, the Word, Sacraments, converſe and traffique with the Saints, thoſe that are known merchants, experimentall Chriſtians; Begging of aſſurance is good buying with God, and of him, ſo you be fervent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in it; Hearing, reading and other exerciſes of the Word, will deliver over more knowledge and power of Chriſt; The Sacraments for beleevers and their ſeed, will to them (and to ſuch I now ſpeak) miniſter ſtrong evidence and conſolation, the immutable things of God (his counſel and oath) are there; <note place="margin">See Heb. 6. 17, 18.</note> and experimental Saints will tell you they never repented of their bargain, God never falſified his oath, or promiſe with them; Frequent, forſake not your aſſemblings together, as the manner of ſome (too many) Chriſtians now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies is,</p>
            <p>I ſhall leave with you ſome quickning ſpurs to diligence, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more aſſurance of Chriſt, and ſo winde up my work, for this <note place="margin">Quickning ſpurs to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian diligence.</note> time and text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You may make your eyes your chapmen; you have found a treaſure, a pearl; you have ſeen it choice and precious, you
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:114102:107"/> have joyed in it; as being well worth all the price that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for; with the eye of <hi>faith</hi> you found it, and with <hi>that,</hi> in the acts and operations of it, you may buy in all the poſſeſſion. O ſtir up the gift that is in you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You have to deal with a faithfull God, who will not, cannot deceive; with a mercifull and bountifull God, who, if you ſeek his Kingdom and righteouſneſſe, will caſt in brown paper and thred, all outward neceſſaries, and when ever theſe things ſhall be taken from you, or you from them, you ſhall have your ſtock entire, your treaſure ſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The more coſt you lay out, the more you will buy. The more you deny, loſe of ſelf, ſinne, creature, and life for Chriſt, the more you will gain of him, and from him. It is incredible, but to thoſe to whom it is experimentall, what comings in they have, who are ſelling, and ſelling every day, and in full trading. They who doe honeſtly but turn the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, make a ſhift to live, but great merchants are enriched to thouſands, and ten thouſands of pounds. <hi>Nothing venture</hi> ('tis moſt true here) <hi>nothing have;</hi> and yet in a true ſenſe I may ſay, you that are ſelling all, with the greateſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, you venture but juſt <hi>nothing,</hi> you have, and ſhall have <hi>all</hi> for it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider 'tis no <hi>adventure</hi> beyond ſea (though above ſea) but a ſure exchange, and a certain return, between hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth: when you firſt found the <hi>Goſpel-treaſure</hi> in the <hi>field</hi> of promiſes, it may be you ventured upon the promiſe, as upon ice; but I have told you often, and now tell you it again, there is good and ſure footing, and no ſlippery ground in a promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt: 'tis <hi>ſure to all the ſeed.</hi> And <hi>now</hi> is your <hi>ſalvation neerer,</hi> and (to every Chriſtian merchant, who holds on his commerce with heaven) <hi>ſurer, then when you firſt beleeved.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 16. &amp; 13. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Diligence is as commendable as gainfull; ſlothfulneſſe and ſelfiſhneſſe ſhamefull. <hi>Seeſt thou a man diligent in his buſineſſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) he ſhall ſtand before Kings: he ſhall not ſtand before mean men.</hi> If diligence raiſeth a man to aſſured preferment amongſt men, what honour, what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:114102:107"/> preferment ſhall the diligent Chriſtian have with God? Doth he not, ſhall he not ſtand before the <hi>King</hi> of heaven, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings?</hi> be known as his favourite, have more teſtimonies of his love? whereas on the contrary? what folly and ſhame in remiſſeneſſe? <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh? having</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the fleſh?</hi> And again ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Ye did run well, who did hinder you?</hi> So as to drive you backwards. Slothfulneſſe makes up the mouths of Papiſts and Arminians, who caſt ſhame upon the doctrine of aſſurance, becauſe of ſome lazy Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Do ſomething the more for example ſake. <hi>Buy</hi> you, and others will be bidding and buying too; <hi>Sell</hi> you, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 14. 2 Cor. 9. 2.</note> will be ſelling alſo. Many of the Brethren in the Lord, waxed confident by <hi>Pauls</hi> bonds. And the <hi>zeal</hi> of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, provoked very many.</hi> So have the zeal of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> without number.</p>
            <p n="7">7. How many have gotten the ſtart of you? are aſſured, and aſſuredly poſſeſſed, while you are caſt behinde? Be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by others forwardneſſe and ſtedfaſtneſſe, if you will not provoke others by yours. And in that ſo many have made ſure of Chriſt, ſtill the more ſure, as they have ſit looſe from the creature, and ſtuck to a promiſe of a purchaſed poſſeſſion: faint not in your mindes, flag not in your hopes, fall not off from your endeavours; double rather and treble your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; <hi>So run, that ye may obtain.</hi> And if you run but ſo as <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> as primitive Chriſtians, as late Martyrs and Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of the truth, you ſhall obtain; and what greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, then to have ſuch fore-runners and companions, and to be ſure of the prize.</p>
            <p>8. Remember 'tis for a treaſure, a pearl of great price, a Crown, a Kingdome. <hi>Be faithfull unto death, and I will</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Revel. 3. 10. 1 Cor. 15. ult.</note> 
               <hi>give thee a crown of life. Be ſtedfaſt</hi> in faith, <hi>and unmovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> in ſelf-denial, <hi>alwaies abounding</hi> in good works, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent uſe of Ordinances, your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord; you <hi>know</hi> it ſhall not be in vain, you have evidence before hand, that you ſhall have a plentifull reward of all your pains.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:114102:108"/> 9. To cloſe up all, You are called to doe nothing, but in the ſtrength of him, who is a treaſure of ſtrength to you. By Goſpel-grace, we come to get Goſpel-treaſure. By Goſpel-grace we come to Goſpel-glory. All the money is put into our purſe to buy with, to deny with, to live, to die with. Our ſelling is an act of grace, and our buying is a fruit of grace, and the fulneſſe of glory attends it. There is enough in this Goſpel-treaſure and pearl to ſtock us, to trade with, and to ſpend upon to all eternity.</p>
