#Vindiciæ redemptionis. In the fanning and sifting of Samuel Oates his exposition upon Mat. 13. 44. With a faithfull search after our Lords meaning in his two parables of the treasure and the pearl. Endeavoured in several sermons upon Mat. 13. 44, 45. Where in the former part, universal redemption is discovered to be a particular errour. (Something here is inserted in answer to Paulus Testardus, touching that tenet.) And in the later part, Christ the peculiar treasure and pearl of Gods elect is laid as the sole foundation; and the Christians faith and joy in him, and self-deniall for him, is raised as a sweet and sure superstructure. / By John Stalham, Pastour of the Church at Terling in Essex.#

1. SCRIPTVRE-REDEMPTION VINDICATED.

    _ Object. 1. As the call by the Word and Spirit depends upon the merit of Chriſts moſt ſufficient death, ſo the preſent wellbeing of the creature; for without that death of his, there had been no place for long-ſuffering and patience towards ſinners
 (which appeareth from the puniſhment of devils, &c.) but the preſent world had been (upon Adams ſin) turned into a hell, in an inſtant.

    _ Obj. 2. But the Apoſtle takes away all ſcruple, and puts it quite out of doubt and queſtion; when as Rom. 2. 1. with 4. charging and accuſing the man endued only with the light of
 natures reliques, and of that moſt common mercy, he reaſoneth thus; Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe, &c.

    _ Obj. 3. What way ſoever God calleth, he calleth ſeriouſly, and deludeth no man.

    _ Obj 4. The acts of divine patience and providence, agree with the calling by Gods Word and Spirit, in the main end, which is the ſalvation of all that are called, and as a means to that end, God would have them all come to the knowledge of the truth, which truth ſpoken of, 1 Tim. 2. 4. TeſtardusThe. 1•0. in this his reaſon compares with Rom. 1. 18. and 25. as if they were all one and the ſame veritas ſalutaris, or ſaving truth.

    _ Ob. 5. But (ſaith The. 1•1.Testardus further) God giveth in that generall light, and way of providence to the Heathen, that which is common to the call of the Word and Spirit, viz. a poſſe illud praestare, an ability to obey their light, & ſalvari, and to be ſaved, if they will, or •ow could they be left without excuſe, had they not that power, et ſi maximè voluiſſent, though they were neverſo willing?

    _ Obj 7. In this, laſtly, the call by the creatures, and good providence of God agreeth, Teſtard. The. 1•3. ſaith our Antagoniſt, with the call by the Word and Spirit, that the grace given in it, deſtroieth not nature, &c.

    _ Object. 8.

    _ That the decree of election, is in order of nature before the decree of redemption.

    _ 2. That Redemption by Christs death, is ſolely and only of, and for the elect, as a fruit of their election.

1. CHRIST, THE Goſpel-Treaſure AND PEARL.
